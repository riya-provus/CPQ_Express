- Only Manager/System Administrator can approve Quotes.
- If another user tries to approve a Quote, an error is shown.

### 2. Discount Validation
- Prevents discount from exceeding allowed limit on Quote Line Items.
- Stops user from saving record if discount is too high.

### 3. Opportunity Stage Automation
- When all Quotes related to an Opportunity are Approved,
  Opportunity Stage automatically updates to Closed Won.
